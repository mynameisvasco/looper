# 🔁 Looper

Looper is a C# framework that provides an robust architecture to develop 
cross-platform desktop applications. The whole idea is about deliver a performant environment with
the less bloatware possible in order to make applications run blazing fast.



### 💡 How is it powered?

Looper uses WebWindowX to present a webview where it is possible to make an entire application using web technologies. If you are interested in learning more about the whole process check out the <a href="https://github.com/mynameisvasco/WebWindowX">WebWindowX repository</a>. The communication between webview and C# code is assured by a callback mechanism, there is no HTTP or sockets involved.



### 📐 How can I see it working?

There is a sample on this repository that tries to demonstrate a simple use case scenario.
